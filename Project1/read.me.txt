I developed my code on Visual studio code at Windows.
If we want to start completely without keeping old data we should wirt delete file: car.txt, dealer.txt and manufacturer.txt
I first created empty txt file for dealers, cars, and manufacturers. Then, I started with adding them into files.
After that, I read all of them as a list. Then, I worked on find special data.
